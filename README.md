# Kublet: ESP32-Based Task Display for Teamwork Projects

Kublet is an ESP32-based IoT device designed to display task information from Teamwork Projects in real-time. This project leverages an ESP32 microcontroller, an LCD screen, and various libraries to fetch, filter, and present tasks assigned to a specific user. It's a handy tool for keeping track of your tasks without needing to check your phone or computer constantly.

## Features
- **Real-Time Task Updates:** Kublet fetches tasks from Teamwork Projects every 10 minutes, ensuring you always have the latest information.
- **User-Specific Filtering:** Displays tasks assigned to a specific user, making it easy to keep track of your personal to-do list.
- **Compact and Standalone:** Powered by the ESP32, the device operates independently, requiring only a Wi-Fi connection to fetch data.
- **Visual Display:** Utilizes a TFT LCD screen to present task details clearly and concisely.

## Components
- **ESP32 Microcontroller:** The heart of the device, handling all processing and communication tasks.
- **TFT LCD Screen:** Displays task information, using the TFT_eSPI library for graphics rendering.
- **Arduino Libraries:** Includes libraries such as `ArduinoJson` for JSON parsing, `HTTPClient` for HTTP requests, and others for handling OTA updates and graphics.

## Setup and Usage
1. **Hardware Requirements:**
   - ESP32 development board
   - TFT LCD screen compatible with the TFT_eSPI library
   - Necessary connections and power supply

2. **Software Requirements:**
   - Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support
   - Required libraries (`ArduinoJson`, `TFT_eSPI`, etc.)

3. **Configuration:**
   - Clone this repository and open the project in Arduino IDE.
   - Create a `secrets.h` file with your Teamwork API Bearer token.
   - Upload the code to your ESP32 device.

4. **Running the Device:**
   - Once powered, the device will connect to Wi-Fi and fetch task data from Teamwork Projects.
   - Tasks assigned to the user specified by `userID` will be displayed on the screen.
